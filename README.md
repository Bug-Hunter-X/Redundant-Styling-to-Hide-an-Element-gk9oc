This repository demonstrates a common mistake in HTML, where developers redundantly use both `display: none;` and `visibility: hidden;` to hide an HTML element.  The correct and efficient way to hide an element is to use only `display: none;`.

The `bug.html` file showcases the incorrect approach.  The `bugSolution.html` file provides the correct solution.
